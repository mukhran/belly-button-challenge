# belly-button-challenge
An interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

- dropdown menu - to select an individual ID and to display their demographic info 
- bar chart shows the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
- bubble chart dislpays each samples as a bubble

The plots are updated when a new Test Subject ID is selected.
